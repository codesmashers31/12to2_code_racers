<h2>Medical</h2>
<p>Access to healthcare expands in the city, with hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies available around the clock. Digital apps can help you find doctors, book appointments, and receive health updates, making routine checkups and emergencies more manageable. In villages, primary health centers are crucial, often supported by periodic medical camps and visiting doctors. Finding the nearest hospital or specialist is easier in the urban setting, 
    but many cities also support rural healthcare initiatives.</p>
